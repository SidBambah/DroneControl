# Drone Control

The purpose of this application and server combination is to use the gyroscope
and acceleration sensors of an Android device to control the movements of a
drone. The Android front-end is constructed to run on any device with Android
API 19 and above. For now, the nodeJS server must be run on a local machine.
Finally, Bluetooth and Wi-Fi capabilities must be present in the Android
device.

	5. Complete server setup and start server before continuing.
	6. Start the Android application on the device.
	7. Choose Connect
	8. Control Drone!!!!
